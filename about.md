## Introduction

Hello, My name is Lian Choi. I love to code and develop various software.

I started programming after I met Virtual Reality for the first time.

I believe that the future of Virtual Reality will provide us with a new life and entertainment as well as a cure for the disabled.

Starting with self-teaching python, I learned how to code in Java as well as C# in Unity.

I like to design sometimes, although I don't have much experience.

My dream is to develop Virtual Reality in either Microsoft or Oculus.
